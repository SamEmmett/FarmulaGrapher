# FarmulaGrapher
Simple program made using Apache Math and JFreeChart

My instructor was sick with Covid so he told my class to make a program that
  1. took numbers 1-100
  2. pluged those values into a formula
  3. then spat out unaltered, altered, smooted, and smoothed datasets
Then he wanted us to use JFreeChart to graph each dataset.
 
Looking back, I should not have used Double, even though it made my life easier.
We had a week to learn both Apache Math and JFreeChart, so my final product was not as thorough as it could have been.
